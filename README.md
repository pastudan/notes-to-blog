# notes-to-blog

Turn your public markdown notes into static HTML.

Goals for this project:

- [x] Be lightweight (e.g. static HTML)
- [x] Minimize user interaction (live deploys on every save)
- [x] Work with common note apps (e.g. Obsidian, Notable, Joplin, etc)
- [ ] Deploy images linked in markdown
